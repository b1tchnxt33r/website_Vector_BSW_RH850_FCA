<p>Change</p>
<p>The time synchronization stack has been extended with more AR4.3 features:</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> StbM now supports</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Virtual local time: Rate correction based on the network time</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Pure local time base: Time base derived from a local clock / counter</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> New API StbM_GetTimeBaseStatus()</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> StbM_SetGlobalTime() can now also be used for offset time bases</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> CanTSyn and FrTSyn now support the AR4.3 defined message format which is incompatible to the message</p>
<p>format defined by AR4.2.2.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> The message format is configurable to support OEMs that require AR4.2.2 message format on the net-</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> EthTsyn is now able to detect Master / Slave conflicts.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> The slave node reports runtime DET error if SYNC messages from multiple master nodes are received.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> The slave node detects the first Master and ignores messages from other master nodes.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> The master node reports a runtime DET error if SYNC messages are received from other master nodes.</p>
<p><b>Migration notes for existing projects:</b></p>
<p>If the OEM requires time synchronization according AR4.2.2 (message format) set the configuration parameter</p>
<p>CanTSynMessageCompatibility resp. FrTSynMessageCompatibility to TRUE.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Type</b></p>
<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p><b>Change ID</b></p>
<p><b>Additional Information</b></p>
<p>Typically Vector will preconfigure this item according to the OEM the SIP has been ordered for.</p>
<p>Breaking</p>
<p>Change</p>
<p>The MICROSAR COM Stack is now able to handle PDU fan-outs in the PduR. This reduces resource consumption</p>
<p>in the Com module as the signals exists only once even if being transmitted on multiple networks.</p>
<p>The PDU fan-out must be modelled in the system template.</p>
<p><b>Important Information</b></p>
<p>In order to realize this feature the naming rules of the upstream mapping have been changed.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Names of PDUs and signals that are created by DaVinci Configurator Pro based on the System</p>
<p>Template are changed during the first database update.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Due to internal improvement in our tooling there have also been other changes with respect to</p>
<p>names that are created by the upstream mapping (System Extract -&gt; EcuC).</p>
<p><b>The implementation has some limitations</b></p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> If a Com I-PDU Group is assigned only to PDUs with a fan-out or fan-in relation the BswM is cur-</p>
<p>rently not able to switch these PDU groups based on the rules created by the auto configuration.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> This is a absolutely untypical use-case and we are currently not aware that such databases</p>
<p>are provided by OEMs.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Enabling and disabling these PDU Groups have to be done manually in the BswM configuration</p>
<p>as otherwise the PDUs will not be processed. Future release will improve this handling.</p>
<p><b>Migration notes for existing projects:</b></p>
<p>Due to the fan-out/fan-in realization and due to the associated renaming of items we have a high impact on the</p>
<p>ECUC configuration:</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> We recommend a ECUC database update when updating to the new SIP. After the update rework may be</p>

<p>required. The extend of the rework is expected to be low as an automatic conversion has been implemented.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> After the update, delete all Com*Notification parameters with the value &quot;Rte_COMCbk*&quot;. Otherwise the Rte</p>
<p>will not update the notifications properly. Once this is done the Rte update mechanism will work properly</p>
<p>again for future updates.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> You can use this as a search query in the Find View using the query &quot;Rte_COMCbk*&quot; to see if you have</p>
<p>not missed any parameter.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Use the find view to jump to the related item and use the multi select feature in grid view to remove all</p>
<p>parameter instances with such a value.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> The affected parameters are /MICROSAR/Com/ComConfig/ComSignal(Group)/Com*Notification</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> The correct Com*Notification values will automatically written within the next calculation phase of the</p>
<p>Rte</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Check connection of Service Ports to your SWCs as some names have changed (especially for ComM)</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Existing configuration items that are created by the upstream mapping will be removed and new items will</p>
<p>be added during the first database update. Vector has implemented a set of rules that take over most con-</p>
<p>figuration settings.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Manual changes to the global PDU in the EcuC module cannot be migrated. If manual changes have been</p>
<p>done to the global PDU collection (we expect that this is a rather untypical use-case) these must be</p>
<p>redone.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> As the new items have changed names, symbolic name values that are used in the application code have</p>
<p>to be adapted. SWCs are not affected as the Rte handles the change.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> The global PDU in the EcuC module has been split. In the past there was one global PDU that was used for</p>
<p>several BSW module interactions (e.g. CanIf to PduR and PduR to Com). Now there is one global PDU for</p>
<p>each BSW module interaction (e.g. one PDU for CanIf to PduR and another PDU for PduR to Com).</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> This change allows more freedom in the global PDU settings but requires selecting the correct global</p>
<p>PDU instance when configuring global PDU references manual (e.g. when using complex drivers).</p>
<p>Breaking</p>
<p>Change</p>
<p>The MICROSAR specific tracing feature has been removed from the CAN stack (&lt;MSN&gt;_ENABLE_TRACING). The</p>
<p>feature is not defined by AUTOSAR and deprecated since some time now.</p>

<p>Extend the code individually in case runtime measurement or tracing is required. This is possible since typically</p>
<p>source code is delivered.</p>
<p>Breaking</p>
<p>Change</p>
<p>The Meta Data handling for Tx CAN PDUs now also covers the CAN-FD and extended CAN-ID flags and now have</p>
<p>32bits instead of 29bit as before.</p>
<p><b>Migration notes for existing projects:</b></p>
<p>To continue to have the old behavior the CanIfTxPduCfg/CanIfTxPduIdMask must typically be extended to 32bits</p>
<p>and the upper 3 bits have to be masked with 1. If the mask is not extended the meta data will be used to define</p>
<p>the Tx message with respect to CAN identifier format (standard/extended) and CAN2.0/CAN-FD message type.</p>
<p><b>Additional Information</b></p>
<p>Please Note:</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> The change does not affect standard CAN PDU Tx objects handling fixed and static PDU ID. It is</p>
<p>relevant for J1939 PDUs and specific gateway PDU configurations where the CAN ID can be set</p>
<p>dynamically by the upper layer.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> MICROSAR modules will provide solving actions to correct the settings to the new mask. A</p>
<p>rework is mainly required if the setting has been done by hand in the past.</p>

<p>FiM has been reworked to AR4.3 architecture. The FiM Technical Reference provides in chapter 3.2 (Major</p>
<p>Changes in AUTOSAR 4.3 version of FiM ) a summary of the changes.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Usage of Dem monitor status bits for calculating the FID states instead of using the UDS status bits</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> FIDs that should be blocked depending on an event’s pending status now need to be</p>
<p>configured separately. Previously, the pending status of any event that was connected via</p>
<p>a normal Inhibition configuration was considered.</p>
<p><b>Migration notes for existing projects:</b></p>
<p>The configuration is taken over from the previous FIM version.</p>
<p>In case of OBD projects, please rework your configuration:</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Set the container structure FimInhibitionConfiguration with the parameter FimInhInhibitionMask to FIM_</p>

<p>The DID signal handling now provides a backward compatibility to the combined signal structure that has been</p>
<p>used with MICROSAR3 and older (&lt;R19) MICROSAR4 releases. The backward compatibility simplifies a takeover</p>
<p>of existing software as the DID signal granularity can remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Data identifiers to be combined to one signal only must have the CANdela Studio attribute ASR3_Legacy_Com-</p>
<p>bine_DID set to 1.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> Without this setting signals are not combined. This is the default for AUTOSAR4 based projects.</p>
<p><b>&gt;</b> If set, the signals are combined to a single signal as it was done by MICROSAR3. The data type of the com-</p>
<p>bined signal is a byte array.</p>
<p><b>Additional Information</b></p>
<p>The attribute (ASR3_Legacy_Combine_DID) must be defined in the CDDT. So it may be necessary to</p>
